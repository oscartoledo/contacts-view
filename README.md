# Contacts List Frontend

This is a test application with Vue.js as Frontend for simple Contacts list

## 1. Fronted App

* Javascript
* Vue.js 2.5
* Vuex 3.0
* Axios
* Vuetify 1.0
* Webpack 3.7.1

I strongly recommend to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for building the application
